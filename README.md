>A blockchain-powered assured contract farming platform that connects farmers with guaranteed buyers through transparent smart contracts, escrow-based payments, and AI-driven market insights.

## Overview

Farmers often face uncertainties in accessing stable markets, leading to unpredictable incomes and financial instability. To address this challenge, we propose the development of an Assured Contract Farming System—a comprehensive platform designed to provide farmers with guaranteed buyers for their crops through transparent, secure, and reliable agreements. The platform will enable farmers to create listings for their crops, negotiate with buyers, and finalize terms using customizable contract templates. Blockchain-based smart contracts will ensure transparency, immutability, and automatic payment processing, while an integrated escrow service will hold payments until the contract terms are fulfilled, safeguarding both parties’ interests. The platform will support multiple payment options, including bank transfers, mobile payments, and cryptocurrency. AI-driven market analytics will empower users to make informed decisions based on real-time trends, crop prices, and demand forecasts. Additionally, a review and performance tracking system will promote accountability, and 24/7 customer support will be available to resolve any technical or operational issues. This system aims to reduce market risks for farmers, enhance income stability, and foster trust between farmers and buyers.

## Vision

Our vision is to empower farmers with guaranteed market access and income stability through transparent and secure contract agreements, supported by blockchain technology and AI-driven market analytics.
## Features

- **Crop Listings**: Farmers can create detailed listings for their crops, specifying yield, quality, and price expectations.

- **Customizable Contract Templates**: Tailored contract templates for agreements covering terms like price, delivery schedules, and payment methods.

- **Interest Button with Instant Notification**: The platform includes an "Interested" button in the crop listing section.
